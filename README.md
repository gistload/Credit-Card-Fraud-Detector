# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detector
Dataset="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud"
It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase. So we created a custom model and trained on the dataset
The dataset has been collected and analysed during a research collaboration of Worldline and the Machine Learning Group (http://mlg.ulb.ac.be) of ULB (Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles) on big data mining and fraud detection.
